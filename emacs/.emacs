;; ===== Set standard indent to 2 rather that 4 ====
(setq standard-indent 2)

;; ========== Line by line scrolling ========== 

;; This makes the buffer scroll by only a single line when the up or
;; down cursor keys push the cursor (tool-bar-mode) outside the
;; buffer. The standard emacs behaviour is to reposition the cursor in
;; the center of the screen, but this can make the scrolling confusing

(setq scroll-step 1)

;; ===== Turn off tab character =====

;;
;; Emacs normally uses both tabs and spaces to indent lines. If you
;; prefer, all indentation can be made from spaces only. To request this,
;; set `indent-tabs-mode' to `nil'. This is a per-buffer variable;
;; altering the variable affects only the current buffer, but it can be
;; disabled for all buffers.

;;
;; Use (setq ...) to set value locally to a buffer
;; Use (setq-default ...) to set value globally 
;;

;; First define a variable which will store the previous column position
(defvar previous-column nil "Save the column position")

;; Define the nuke-line function. The line is killed, then the newline
;; character is deleted. The column which the cursor was positioned at is then
;; restored. Because the kill-line function is used, the contents deleted can
;; be later restored by usibackward-delete-char-untabifyng the yank commands.

  ;; Store the current column position, so it can later be restored for a more
  ;; natural feel to the deletion

  ;; Now move to the end of the current line
  (end-of-line)

  ;; Test the length of the line. If it is 0, there is no need for a
  ;; kill-line. All that happens in this case is that the new-line character
  ;; is deleted.

    ;; This is the 'else' clause. The current line being deleted is not zero
    ;; in length. First remove the line by moving to its start and then
    ;; killing, followed by deletion of the newline character, and then
    ;; finally restoration of the column position.
